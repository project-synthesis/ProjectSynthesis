## Immediate

### Taxonomy observatory — live domain & sub-domain lifecycle dashboard
**Status:** Exploring
**Context:** The taxonomy engine now discovers domains and sub-domains organically from user activity through a three-source signal pipeline (domain_raw qualifiers, Haiku-generated vocabulary, dynamic TF-IDF keywords). The warm path runs every 5 minutes, making discovery decisions with full observability events logged to JSONL. Readiness endpoints + sparklines + topology overlay shipped in v0.3.37–v0.3.38 cover the per-domain lifecycle surface; the Observatory extends that into a first-class panel with cross-domain trajectories.

**Vision:** A "Taxonomy Observatory" panel that gives users creative and functional insights into their prompt catalogue's structure, growth trajectory, and optimization opportunities. Inspired by the Tamagotchi/buddy concept — the taxonomy is a living system that the user cultivates through their prompting activity.

**Core capabilities:**

1. **Domain lifecycle timeline** — visual history of when domains and sub-domains were discovered, how they grew, and which signals triggered their creation. Shows the three-source pipeline contribution per domain (how much came from domain_raw vs vocabulary matching vs dynamic keywords). Users see their taxonomy growing organically as they use the system.

2. **Sub-domain readiness indicators** — for each domain, show which potential sub-domains are approaching the creation threshold. "SaaS pricing is at 17% — needs 40% to form a sub-domain. 23 more pricing-focused prompts would get you there." This steers users toward concentrating their activity in areas where the taxonomy can provide richer organization. (Per-domain surface already shipped as `DomainStabilityMeter` + `SubDomainEmergenceList` in v0.3.37.)

3. **Pattern density heatmap** — which domains/sub-domains have the richest pattern libraries (most MetaPatterns, highest injection rates, best score lift). Highlights where the taxonomy is adding the most value and where it's thin.

4. **Dynamic steering suggestions** — based on taxonomy state, suggest actions that would improve coverage. Observational, never prescriptive.

5. **Vocabulary transparency** — show which qualifier vocabularies are active per domain (static, LLM-generated, or dynamic TF-IDF), what keywords they contain, and how recently they were refreshed. Users can see exactly why the system classified their prompt as "backend: auth" and provide feedback if the classification is wrong.

6. **Cross-domain pattern flow** — visualize how patterns propagate across domains via GlobalPatterns and cross-cluster injection.

**Steering model (exploratory):** Key principles:
- Steering is observational, not prescriptive
- Suggestions are contextual — shown when the user is in a relevant domain, not as global notifications
- Transparent about reasoning — every suggestion links to the underlying data
- Gamification is minimal — progress indicators yes, achievements/badges no
- The user's prompting freedom is never constrained — steering is purely advisory

**Data sources (already available):**
- Taxonomy events JSONL (`data/taxonomy_events/`) — full decision history
- Ring buffer (500 events) — real-time stream via SSE `taxonomy_activity` events
- Readiness history JSONL (`data/readiness_history/`) — 30-day rolling snapshots with hourly bucketing beyond 7d
- `GET /api/clusters/tree`, `/api/clusters/stats`, `/api/clusters/activity`
- `GET /api/domains/readiness`, `/api/domains/{id}/readiness`, `/api/domains/{id}/readiness/history`

**Prerequisites:** Signal-driven sub-domain discovery (shipped v0.3.25), LLM-generated qualifier vocabulary (shipped v0.3.32), taxonomy event observability (shipped v0.3.25), readiness telemetry + history (shipped v0.3.37–v0.3.38). Data infrastructure is complete — this is a frontend visualization and UX design challenge.

**Files:** New `frontend/src/lib/components/taxonomy/TaxonomyObservatory.svelte`. Possibly new `backend/app/routers/taxonomy_insights.py` for aggregated steering suggestions. Possibly new `frontend/src/lib/stores/observatory.svelte.ts`.

## Planned

### Live pattern intelligence — real-time context awareness during prompt authoring
**Status:** Planned (design phase — pre-implementation)
**Spec:** [ADR-007](adr/ADR-007-live-pattern-intelligence.md)
**Context:** The pattern suggestion system only triggers on paste events (50+ char delta). Users typing prompts keystroke-by-keystroke receive zero guidance from the taxonomy's accumulated knowledge until they submit. The backend has every capability needed — embedding search (~200ms), heuristic classification (~30ms), strategy intelligence (~100ms).

**Scope:** 3-tier progressive intelligence: (1) live pattern matching as the user types (replaces paste-only detection), (2) enrichment preview showing classification, weaknesses, and strategy recommendations before submission, (3) proactive inline hints for strategy mismatches, missing repo context, and refinement opportunities. New `POST /api/clusters/preview-enrichment` endpoint, new `ContextPanel.svelte` sidebar, deprecation of single-banner `PatternSuggestion.svelte`. Each tier is independently shippable.

**Implementation status:** None of phases A–E shipped as of 2026-04-19. All composed primitives are in place — work is UI orchestration.

**Impact:** Transforms optimization from a black box into a transparent authoring partner.

---

### Integration store — pluggable context providers beyond GitHub
**Status:** Planned
**Context:** GitHub is the sole external integration — codebase context for the explore phase plus the project-creation trigger (ADR-005). Two problems: (1) non-developers have zero external context enrichment, (2) the project system is coupled to GitHub repos as the primary link source.

**Vision:** A VS Code-style integration "store" where GitHub is one installable provider among many. Each integration is a self-contained plugin that provides a context source (documents for the explore phase), a project trigger (linking creates a project node), and optionally domain keyword seeds and heuristic weakness signals for its vertical.

**Architecture:**
- **ContextProvider protocol** — each integration implements `list_documents(project_id) -> list[Document]` and `fetch_document(id) -> str`. The existing `ContextEnrichmentService` dispatches to whichever provider is linked for the active project. GitHub's current implementation becomes the first provider, not a special case.
- **Hybrid-taxonomy fit** — ADR-005's hybrid taxonomy (projects as sibling roots at `parent_id=NULL`) already normalizes `Optimization.project_id` as the attribution axis. The Integration Store generalizes provider-side: each provider creates a `PromptCluster` with `state="project"` via `project_service.ensure_project_for_repo()` (or its sibling for non-repo providers) and maintains its own link record. `LinkedRepo.project_node_id` stays as the GitHub-specific link record; the generalized contract is a `LinkedSource` protocol where each provider owns its link table (or a shared polymorphic link table).
- **Provider lifecycle** — install (enable provider), configure (auth + link a source), unlink (preserve data, clear link), uninstall (disable provider). Each provider brings its own auth flow (GitHub OAuth, Google OAuth, Notion API key, no auth for local files).
- **Frontend: Integrations panel** — new Navigator section showing installed providers with install/configure/unlink controls. Replaces the current GitHub-specific Navigator section.

**Candidate providers:**

| Provider | Vertical | Context source | Auth |
|----------|----------|---------------|------|
| GitHub | Developers | Repo files, README, architecture docs | OAuth (Device Flow) |
| Google Drive | Business/marketing | Documents, spreadsheets, brand guidelines | OAuth |
| Notion | Product/content | Pages, databases, knowledge bases | API key |
| Local filesystem | Anyone | Any directory on disk | None |
| Confluence | Enterprise | Wiki pages, project specs | API token |
| Figma | Design | Design system docs, component specs | API key |

**Supersedes:** The former "Project Workspaces — explicit project_id override" item. ADR-005 F3 already shipped explicit `project_id` on `/api/optimize`, `/api/refine`, and `synthesis_optimize`; the remaining work is the provider abstraction itself.

**Prerequisite:** ADR-006 (universal engine principle). The integration store is the concrete mechanism that makes the universal engine accessible to non-developer verticals.

**Files:** New `backend/app/services/integrations/` package (provider protocol, registry, lifecycle). Refactor `github_repos.py` → provider implementation. New `backend/app/routers/integrations.py`. Frontend `Integrations` panel. Migration for `LinkedSource` generalization or per-provider link tables.

---

### Non-developer onboarding pathway
**Status:** Partially shipped — engine parity complete, UI adaptation remains
**Context:** ADR-006 established that the engine is already universal. Work shipped in v0.3.x verifies this: seed-agent hot-reload, organic domain discovery, signal loader, removal of `VALID_DOMAINS`/`DOMAIN_COLORS`/`KNOWN_DOMAINS`/`_DOMAIN_SIGNALS`, domain lifecycle with no seed protection. A non-developer using Project Synthesis today gets correct clustering, pattern discovery, and scoring — but the UI still assumes developer context: GitHub OAuth in the sidebar, "Clusters" and "Taxonomy" jargon, 5 developer-only seed agents, codebase scanning references in Settings.

**Remaining work:**

1. **Content-first vertical additions** (ADR-006 playbook) — add marketing/writing/business seed agents to `prompts/seed-agents/`. Add domain keyword seeds via Alembic migration for non-dev domains. Add heuristic weakness signals for non-dev verticals. Lowest effort, relies on organic discovery once seeded.

2. **Adaptive UI labels** — taxonomy concepts get user-facing aliases based on the active vertical. "Clusters" → "Pattern groups" for non-developers. "Domains" → "Categories." "Meta-patterns" → "Proven techniques." The underlying data model is unchanged — only display labels adapt. Driven by a `vertical: "developer" | "general"` preference.

3. **Vertical-aware onboarding** — first-run flow asks "What do you primarily use AI for?" Selection configures: which integrations are highlighted, what seed agents appear in the SeedModal, what language the UI uses, which Navigator sections are visible by default. Depends on the Integration Store item above for GitHub to become one of many.

**Recommended order:** (1) → (2) → (3). Each step is independently valuable and shippable.

**Spec:** [ADR-006](adr/ADR-006-universal-prompt-engine.md)

### Hierarchical topology navigation — project → domain → cluster → prompt (target: v0.4.0)
**Status:** Planned (targeted for v0.4.0 — edge system shipped in v0.3.30; drill-down is a major render-pipeline rewrite)
**Context:** The current 3D topology view (`SemanticTopology`) renders ALL nodes in a single scene: project nodes, domain nodes, active clusters, candidates, mature clusters — 76+ nodes at current scale. At 200+ clusters across 3 projects, this becomes visually overwhelming. Domain nodes (structural grouping) and active clusters (semantic content) serve different purposes but are rendered identically in the same space. There is no way to "zoom into" a project or domain.

**Vision:** A hierarchical drill-down topology inspired by filesystem navigation. Each level of the taxonomy hierarchy gets its own view with appropriate aesthetics and interaction patterns:

**Level 0: Project Space** — outermost view showing project nodes as large entities with gravitational relationships. Distance reflects semantic similarity; size reflects optimization count; color reflects dominant domain. Projects with cross-project GlobalPatterns have visible connection lines. Double-click to drill in.

**Level 1: Domain Map** (per project) — shows the domains within a selected project. Each domain is a region or cluster with its own color. Size reflects member count; distance reflects domain overlap. Sub-domains nested. Double-click to drill in.

**Level 2: Cluster View** (per domain) — the current topology experience scoped to a single domain's clusters. No domain nodes at this level — they're the parent you drilled from. Lifecycle state coloring (active, mature, candidate). Double-click to drill in.

**Level 3: Prompt Detail** (per cluster) — individual optimizations within a cluster. Each node is a prompt. Size reflects score; color reflects improvement delta; position reflects embedding proximity. Hover shows prompt text; click loads it in the editor. New visualization replacing the current cluster detail panel's optimization list.

**Navigation:**
- Breadcrumb bar: `All Projects › user/backend-api › backend › API Endpoint Patterns`
- Back / Escape returns to parent level
- Smooth zoom transitions (like macOS folder zoom)
- Each level preserves camera position when returning
- Ctrl+F search works across all levels

**Per-level aesthetics:**
- L0 (projects): large glowing orbs, minimal, wide spacing, slow drift. Ambient starfield
- L1 (domains): colored regions with soft boundaries, domain labels prominent, keyword clouds on hover
- L2 (clusters): current wireframe contour style, lifecycle state encoding, force layout — most data-dense level
- L3 (prompts): small nodes, text-preview on hover, score-gradient coloring, tight clustering

**Technical approach:**
- Each level is a separate Three.js scene (or scene state) with its own camera, lighting, and node renderer
- Level transitions animated (camera fly-through + node scale/fade)
- Data loading is lazy — L2 and L3 data fetched on drill-down
- Existing `TopologyData`, `TopologyRenderer`, `TopologyInteraction` refactor into level-aware variants
- `GET /api/clusters/tree?project_id=...` (ADR-005 B6, shipped) provides per-project data. New endpoints for per-domain and per-cluster detail views
- `TopologyWorker` force simulation runs per-level (different force parameters per level)

**Single-project behavior:** When only one project exists (Legacy or a single repo), skip Level 0 and open directly at Level 1.

**Legacy project:** Always visible at Level 0 as a permanent sibling root (ADR-005 hybrid). Contains all pre-repo and non-repo optimizations.

**ADR-006 label adaptation:** Level labels respect the active vertical. Developers: Projects → Domains → Clusters → Optimizations. Non-developers: Workspaces → Categories → Pattern groups → Prompts. Driven by the preference from the non-developer onboarding item.

**Prerequisites:** ADR-005 hybrid (shipped). The Integration Store for project creation beyond GitHub. Non-developer onboarding for vertical-aware labels.

**Files:** Major frontend refactor. New `TopologyLevel0…3` components. Refactored `TopologyNavigation` with breadcrumb + back. New `topology-state.svelte.ts` store for current level + drill path. New backend endpoints for per-domain cluster lists and per-cluster optimization lists with spatial data. Updated `TopologyWorker` with per-level force configs.

### MCP routing fallback — per-client capability awareness
**Status:** Planned
**Context:** MCP tool calls from non-sampling clients (e.g., Claude Code) are routed to the sampling tier when a sampling-capable client (VS Code bridge) is also connected. The call fails with "Method not found" because the calling client doesn't support `sampling/createMessage`. The internal provider is available but bypassed because `caller="mcp"` + `sampling_capable=true` (global flag) routes to sampling.

**Root cause:** The routing resolver checks global `sampling_capable` state, not per-client capabilities.

**Proposed approaches:**
1. **Per-client capability tagging** — track each MCP session's declared capabilities from `initialize`. Route based on the calling session's sampling support, not the global flag.
2. **Internal fallback for MCP** — if sampling fails for an MCP caller, retry on internal pipeline when a provider exists. Simpler but reactive.
3. **Prefer internal for non-interactive MCP** — default MCP tool calls to internal when a provider exists. Only use sampling when explicitly requested. Preserves IDE LLM quota.

**Files:** `services/routing.py` (resolve_route), `mcp_server.py` (capability middleware), `tools/optimize.py` (context construction)

---

### REST-to-sampling proxy via IDE session registry
**Status:** Planned
**Context:** The web UI cannot perform MCP sampling because `POST /api/optimize` uses `caller="rest"`, which routing correctly blocks from sampling. A previous sampling proxy was removed in v0.3.16-dev because it was architecturally broken: the proxy opened a new MCP session with no sampling handler.

**Root cause:** MCP's `create_message()` is a server-to-client request that goes to the session that made the tool call. No mechanism exists to route a sampling request through a *different* client's session.

**Proposed solution:** The MCP server maintains a session registry mapping session IDs to declared capabilities. When a non-sampling client calls `synthesis_optimize` and routing selects sampling tier:
1. Tool handler queries the registry for any active sampling-capable session
2. If found, borrows that session's `create_message()` channel
3. Original caller receives the result when the IDE completes sampling
4. If no sampling session exists, falls back to internal/passthrough with clear error

**Complexity:** Medium-high. Requires cross-session request routing in FastMCP, proper cleanup when IDE sessions disconnect mid-request, race-condition handling.

**Files:** `mcp_server.py` (session registry + lifecycle hooks), `services/mcp_proxy.py` (optional), `tools/optimize.py`, `services/routing.py`

---

### Unified scoring service
**Status:** Planned
**Context:** The scoring orchestration (heuristic compute → historical stats fetch → hybrid blend → delta compute) is repeated across `pipeline.py`, `sampling_pipeline.py`, `save_result.py`, and `optimize.py` with divergent error handling. A shared `ScoringService` would eliminate duplication and ensure consistent behavior across all tiers.
**Spec:** Code quality audit (2026-03-27) identified this as the #3 finding

---

### Unified onboarding journey
**Status:** Planned
**Context:** The current system has 3 separate tier-specific modals (InternalGuide, SamplingGuide, PassthroughGuide) firing independently on routing tier detection. This creates a fragmented first-run experience — users only see one tier's guide and miss the others.

**Two changes required:**

1. **Consolidated onboarding modal:** Replace the 3 separate modals with a single multi-step journey walking through all 3 tiers sequentially. Each tier section is actionable — user must acknowledge each before proceeding. Modal blocks the UI until all steps are actioned. Fires at every startup unless "Don't show again" is checked and persisted.

2. **Dynamic routing change toasts:** Replace per-tier-change modal triggers with concise inline toasts that explain *what caused* the routing change ("Routing changed to passthrough — no provider detected"). Fire only on *automatic* tier transitions, not manual toggles.

**Prerequisite:** Refactor `tier-onboarding.svelte.ts`, merge 3 guide components, new `onboarding-dismissed` preference field.

---

### Pipeline progress visualization — optimize/refine streaming previews
**Status:** Planned (GitHub indexing shipped v0.3.40 with full phase SSE)
**Context:** GitHub indexing now publishes live `index_phase_changed` SSE events (`pending → fetching_tree → embedding → synthesizing → ready|error`) with files_seen/files_total counters and synthesized error messages. Optimize and refine flows still lack rich progress — they show a phase indicator and step counter (v0.3.8-dev) but no streaming preview, estimated time, or per-phase timing surfaced in the UI.

**Scope:** Stream partial tokens from the optimize/refine phases into the Inspector so users see the optimizer working. Per-phase timing breakdown in the Inspector footer (analyze X ms, optimize Y ms, score Z ms). Estimated remaining time based on rolling per-phase histograms. Tier-adaptive visualization — sampling tier shows IDE-side progress, passthrough shows "waiting on user to paste".

**Files:** `routers/optimize.py` (SSE payload extensions), `frontend/src/lib/components/layout/Inspector.svelte` (streaming preview slot), possibly a new `PhaseTimingStrip.svelte` component.

---

## Exploring

### Domain FK on Optimization table
**Status:** Exploring
**Context:** `Optimization.domain` is currently a `String` column storing the domain node's label (e.g., `"backend"`). Resolution uses label lookup against `PromptCluster` rows where `state='domain'`. This works correctly via `DomainResolver` but requires subqueries for domain-level aggregations. Adding an optional `domain_cluster_id` FK to `PromptCluster.id` would enable direct JOINs.

**Triggers (implement when any becomes a priority):**

1. **Domain-level analytics dashboard** — average score improvement per domain over time, member count trends, strategy effectiveness.
2. **Domain-scoped strategy affinity** — the adaptation tracker currently tracks `(task_type, strategy)` pairs. Domain-scoped tracking — `(domain, strategy)` — would enable insights like "chain-of-thought works best for security prompts". Most likely trigger.
3. **Cross-domain relationship graph** — weighted edges between domain nodes in the topology. FK enables `GROUP BY domain_cluster_id` aggregations.

**Migration:** Add nullable `domain_cluster_id` FK alongside existing `domain` String. Backfill from label lookup. Both columns coexist. Non-breaking.
**Decision:** ADR-004 deferred this as YAGNI. Revisit when a concrete feature requires domain-level JOINs.

---

### Conciseness heuristic calibration for technical prompts
**Status:** Exploring
**Context:** The heuristic conciseness scorer uses Type-Token Ratio which penalizes repeated domain terminology ("scoring", "heuristic", "pipeline" across sections). Technical specification prompts score artificially low on conciseness despite being well-structured. Needs a domain-aware TTR adjustment or alternative metric.

---

### PostgreSQL migration
**Status:** Exploring
**Context:** SQLite's single-writer limitation causes `database is locked` errors when the MCP server pipeline (optimization write) and backend warm path (taxonomy mutations) write concurrently. WAL mode + busy_timeout=30s mitigates but doesn't eliminate the issue. At scale (concurrent users, parallel optimizations), SQLite becomes a bottleneck.

**Scope:** Replace `aiosqlite` with `asyncpg` + PostgreSQL. Requires: Alembic migration infrastructure (already present), connection pooling config, Docker Compose for local dev, production deployment update, test fixture changes.

**Trigger:** When `database is locked` errors become user-facing despite busy_timeout, or when concurrent multi-user access is needed.

**Files:** `database.py` (engine), `config.py` (DATABASE_URL), `main.py`/`mcp_server.py` (PRAGMA removal), `docker-compose.yml` (new), all test fixtures.

---

### LLM domain classification — remaining optimizations
**Status:** Exploring (core heuristic pipeline shipped v0.3.30)
**Context:** v0.3.30 shipped the heuristic accuracy pipeline: compound keywords (A1), technical verb+noun disambiguation (A2), TF-IDF domain signal auto-enrichment (A3), confidence-gated Haiku LLM fallback (A4). Classification agreement tracking (E1) provides ongoing measurement. Prompt-context divergence detection (B1+B2) ships tech stack conflict alerts with 4-category intent classification.

**Remaining future optimizations (exploring, not yet designed):**
- **Constrained decoding** — `Literal` enum on `AnalysisResult.domain` to restrict LLM output at schema level
- **Dynamic text fallback keywords** — `_build_analysis_from_text()` uses hardcoded keywords instead of `DomainSignalLoader`
- **DomainResolver confidence-aware caching** — unknown domain cached as "general" at low confidence persists; self-corrects on `load()`
- **C2: Heuristic-to-LLM reconciliation** — use accumulated E1 disagreement data to adjust keyword weights over time. Requires `signal_adjuster.py`
- **E1b: Cross-process agreement bridge** — MCP process agreement data invisible to health endpoint. Needs HTTP POST forwarding

**Specs:** [`docs/heuristic-analyzer-refresh.md`](heuristic-analyzer-refresh.md), [`docs/enrichment-consolidation-action-items.md`](enrichment-consolidation-action-items.md), [`docs/specs/phase-a-heuristic-accuracy-a3-a4.md`](specs/phase-a-heuristic-accuracy-a3-a4.md)

---

### Hybrid taxonomy empty-state polish
**Status:** Exploring
**Context:** ADR-005 F5 shipped the empty-state panel for scoped project views (when "show project X" has zero clusters). Copy is intentionally generic today ("This project has no clusters yet"). Once the non-developer onboarding pathway lands, per-vertical copy would sharpen the message — e.g., "Start optimizing marketing copy" vs. "Start optimizing code prompts" — driven by the same `vertical` preference.

**Prerequisite:** Non-developer onboarding pathway (adaptive UI labels step).

---

## Deferred

### Passthrough refinement UX
**Status:** Deferred (low demand)
**Context:** Passthrough results cannot be refined (returns 503). Refinement requires an LLM provider to rewrite the prompt. Users who passthrough have their own external LLM — refinement would need a different interaction model (show the assembled refinement prompt for copy-paste like the initial passthrough flow).
**Rationale:** Users who use passthrough can iterate manually.

---

### ADR-005 Phase 3 — HNSW + round-robin at scale
**Status:** Deferred (trigger-gated)
**Context:** ADR-005's Phase 3 work is partially shipped (`_HnswBackend` exists in `backend/app/services/taxonomy/embedding_index.py`, activated at `HNSW_CLUSTER_THRESHOLD=1000`; `AdaptiveScheduler` shipped as part of B-layer). The deferred piece is large-corpus stress validation — trigger condition (≥1000 clusters sustained across warm cycles) has not been reached at current v0.3.41-dev scale.

**Trigger:** When a real corpus crosses the 1000-cluster threshold for multiple consecutive warm cycles, amend ADR-005 with validation results and any scheduler tuning that proves necessary at scale.

**Files:** Amendment to `docs/adr/ADR-005-taxonomy-scaling-architecture.md`. Potentially `backend/app/services/taxonomy/_constants.py` for tuned thresholds.

---

## Completed (recent)

### v0.3.41-dev (in flight)
- **Opus 4.7 feature surface** — `xhigh` effort level, `display: "summarized"` adaptive thinking, Task Budgets beta, Compaction beta. Wired through `LLMProvider` ABC (`backend/app/providers/base.py`), `AnthropicAPIProvider`, `ClaudeCLIProvider`, preferences validation, Navigator effort selector. 11 new provider tests + 3 preferences tests.
- **Phase 0 orphan-structural-node sweep** — warm path reconciles empty domain / sub-domain nodes with 0 children + 0 opt references (≥24h age gate). Fixes zero-prompt "ghost Legacy" visibility bug. 5 RED→GREEN tests.
- **Heuristic classifier audit verbs + sentence boundary fix** — `audit`/`diagnose`/`inspect` verbs added to analysis signals; first-sentence boundary now handles `?` / `!` terminators.
- **B0 repo-relevance gate false-positive fix** — domain vocabulary overlap evaluated before cosine floor short-circuit. Prompts targeting subsystems of broad repos now receive codebase context.
- **Background task strong-ref holder** — `asyncio.create_task` calls in `link_repo` / `reindex` now held in module-level set to prevent GC mid-flight (was silently killing `synthesis_status='running'` jobs).
- **Inspector "no codebase context" warning chip** — surfaces when optimization ran against linked repo but B0 gate fired or index wasn't ready.
- **MBR column semantic suffix** — navigator member_count now renders as `Nd` (domains), `Nc` (clusters), `Nm` (members) per node type.

### ADR-005 Multi-project hybrid taxonomy (v0.3.27 → v0.3.41-dev)
- **S1 schema migration** — `dominant_project_id` FK on `PromptCluster` (`backend/alembic/versions/d9e0f1a2b3c4_add_dominant_project_id_to_prompt_cluster.py`)
- **B1 pipeline** — explicit `project_id` in all optimize/refine/sampling/batch pipelines; Legacy cache in both backend and MCP lifespans
- **B2-B5 migration + link/unlink contract** — `POST /api/projects/migrate` rate-limited router; `link_repo` returns `migration_candidates`; `unlink_repo?mode=keep|rehome`
- **B6 hybrid tree/stats scope** — `/api/clusters/tree`, `/stats`, `/similarity-edges` accept `?project_id=X` + `?scope=all`; engine `_stats_cache` keyed per-project
- **B7-B8 patterns** — `auto_inject_patterns(project_id=None)` threads `project_filter`; `GlobalPattern` requires `distinct_project_count >= GLOBAL_PATTERN_MIN_PROJECTS`
- **C1a-C1c warm/cold maintenance** — Phase 0 + cold path write `dominant_project_id`; `_reassign_to_active()` prefers same-project target with `CROSS_PROJECT_REASSIGN_MARGIN=0.10` cosine margin
- **F1-F5 frontend** — `projectStore`, project selector dropdown, explicit `project_id` in all mutating calls, tree/topology/pattern consumer re-fetch on store change, link/unlink transition toasts with `addWithActions()`, per-project Inspector breakdown, empty-state panel
- **See:** [`docs/adr/ADR-005-taxonomy-scaling-architecture.md`](adr/ADR-005-taxonomy-scaling-architecture.md) (Amendment 2026-04-19), `docs/hybrid-taxonomy-plan.md`

### Templates entity + fork-on-promotion (v0.3.39)
Immutable `PromptTemplate` rows forked from mature clusters crossing fork thresholds. Source cluster stays `mature` and keeps learning. Warm Phase 0 reconciles `template_count` + auto-retires templates whose source degrades (avg_score < 6.0) or is archived. Templates router (`GET /api/templates`, `POST /api/clusters/{id}/fork-template`, `POST /api/templates/{id}/retire`, `POST /api/templates/{id}/use`). Partial-unique constraint on `(source_cluster_id, source_optimization_id) WHERE retired_at IS NULL`. Halo rendering on 3D topology (`template_count > 0` → 1px contour ring). Navigator PROVEN TEMPLATES group + Inspector collapsible section. `.claude/hooks/pre-pr-template-guard.sh` blocks residual `state='template'` literals. Deprecates the old `state='template'` enum path (410/400 on legacy routes).

### GitHub indexing pipeline with caching (v0.3.40)
Four coordinated caches cut GitHub API pressure and embedder cost: tree ETag conditional fetches, content-hash embedding dedup across branches/repos, file-content TTL+FIFO cache (keyed by blob SHA, branch-independent), curated retrieval invalidation on rebuild. Per-phase `index_phase` column (`pending → fetching_tree → embedding → synthesizing → ready|error`) with `index_phase_changed` SSE events. Frontend `connectionState` expanded to 7 states; phase-aware Navigator badge + pulse animation + error row. Preference key rename `enable_adaptation` → `enable_strategy_intelligence` (+ lazy migration). Shared file-exclusion filters (`file_filters.py`) between repo-index and codebase-explorer.

### Domain readiness telemetry + sparklines + topology overlay (v0.3.37 → v0.3.38 → v0.3.39)
`GET /api/domains/readiness` + `/api/domains/{id}/readiness` with 30s TTL cache; three-source cascade primitive shared with `_propose_sub_domains()` for zero-drift. `DomainStabilityMeter`, `SubDomainEmergenceList`, `DomainReadinessPanel` UI with per-row mute bells + master mute. Readiness snapshot writer (`readiness_history.py`) with JSONL daily rotation + 30-day retention. `GET /api/domains/{id}/readiness/history?window=24h|7d|30d` with hourly bucketing beyond 7d. `DomainReadinessSparkline` peer component with window selector (persisted to localStorage). Tier-crossing detector with 2-cycle hysteresis + per-domain cooldown publishes `domain_readiness_changed` SSE gated by `domain_readiness_notifications` preference (default on). Topology overlay: per-domain readiness ring with composite tier coloring (`composeReadinessTier()`), billboard orientation, LOD attenuation, cubic-bezier tier transitions, `prefersReducedMotion()` awareness. 1142+ frontend tests passing (brand-guard + behavioral).

### Opus 4.7 default + mypy strict cleanup (v0.3.37)
`MODEL_OPUS` default flipped to `claude-opus-4-7` (1M-token native context). Full mypy strict cleanup: 103 → 0 errors across 133 source files; `backend/app/models.py` refactored to SQLAlchemy 2.0 `Mapped[]` typed declarative columns.

### Enrichment engine consolidation + heuristic accuracy (v0.3.30)
Unified context enrichment with auto-selected profiles (`code_aware` / `knowledge_work` / `cold_start`), task-gated curated retrieval, strategy intelligence merge, workspace guidance collapse. Heuristic accuracy pipeline: compound keywords (A1), verb+noun disambiguation (A2), TF-IDF domain signal auto-enrichment (A3), confidence-gated Haiku fallback (A4). Prompt-context divergence detection (B1+B2), domain-relaxed fallback queries (C1), classification agreement tracking (E1). 2107 backend tests. Full spec: [`docs/enrichment-consolidation-action-items.md`](enrichment-consolidation-action-items.md).

### Hierarchical edge system (v0.3.30)
Curved edge bundling in 3D topology with depth-based attenuation shader, density-adaptive opacity, proximity suppression, focus-reveal on hover, domain-colored edges. 5-phase hierarchical edge declutter.

### Injection effectiveness + orphan recovery + project-node UX (v0.3.29)
Warm-path Phase 4 measures mean score lift for pattern-injected vs non-injected optimizations. Orphan recovery with exponential backoff. Project node dodecahedron geometry + rich Inspector mode.

### SSE health + incremental refresh + per-project scheduling (v0.3.28)
Real-time SSE latency tracking (p50/p95/p99), degradation detection, exponential backoff reconnection. Repo index incremental refresh via SHA comparison. Per-project scheduler budgets with proportional quotas.

### Full source context + import graph + curated retrieval (v0.3.27)
Curated retrieval delivers actual file source code (not outlines). Import-graph expansion, test file exclusion, cross-domain noise filter, performance signals, context diagnostic panel. Skip-and-continue budget packing, source-type soft caps.

### Alembic migration for domain nodes (v0.3.8-dev)
Idempotent migration `a1b2c3d4e5f6`: adds `cluster_metadata` column, `ix_prompt_cluster_state_label` index, `uq_prompt_cluster_domain_label` partial unique index, seeds 7 domain nodes with keyword metadata, re-parents existing clusters, backfills `Optimization.domain`. Async env.py commit for DML persistence.

### Unified domain taxonomy — ADR-004 (v0.3.8-dev)
Domains are `PromptCluster` nodes with `state="domain"`. Replaces all hardcoded domain constants (`VALID_DOMAINS`, `DOMAIN_COLORS`, `KNOWN_DOMAINS`, `_DOMAIN_SIGNALS`). `DomainResolver` and `DomainSignalLoader` provide cached DB-driven resolution. Warm path discovers new domains organically from coherent "general" sub-populations. Five stability guardrails, tree integrity with auto-repair, stats cache with trend tracking. Supersedes the planned "Multi-label domain classification" item. See [`docs/adr/ADR-004-unified-domain-taxonomy.md`](adr/ADR-004-unified-domain-taxonomy.md).

### Multi-dimensional domain classification (v0.3.7-dev)
LLM analyze prompt and heuristic analyzer output "primary: qualifier" format (e.g., "backend: security"). Taxonomy clustering, Pattern Graph edges, and color resolution parse the primary for comparison while preserving qualifier for display. Zero schema changes.

### Zero-LLM heuristic suggestions (v0.3.6-dev)
Deterministic suggestions from weakness analysis, score dimensions, and strategy context for the passthrough tier. 18 unit tests.

### Structural pattern extraction (v0.3.6-dev)
Zero-LLM meta-pattern extraction via score delta detection and structural regex. Passthrough results now contribute patterns to the taxonomy knowledge graph.

### Process-level singleton RoutingManager (v0.3.6-dev)
Fixed 6 routing tier bugs caused by per-session RoutingManager replacement in FastMCP's Streamable HTTP transport.

### Inspector metadata parity (v0.3.6-dev)
All tiers now show provider, scoring mode, model, suggestions, changes, domain, and duration in the Inspector panel.

### Electric neon domain palette (v0.3.6-dev)
Domain colors overhauled to vibrant neon tones with zero overlap to tier accent colors. Sharp wireframe contour nodes matching the brand's zero-effects directive.
